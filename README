# Posible theoric problem about Fedora 40 in VMware Workstation with 3D acceleration

After make some changes like removing the next package:
`sddm-plasma` and installing sddm-x11 for force use Xorg and removing wayland i discover IT'S NOT VMware Tools and not it's Xorg and Wayland.

It's the driver module "vmwgfx" if you write glxinfo | grep OpenGL

Can see SVGA3D Adapter
Acceleration: No
VRAM: 1MB

So that's a problem about vmwgfx
